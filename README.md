So Make It Website
==================

This repo holds the So Make It website's source code. Please feel free
to submit small pull requests e.g. to fix typos/correct wording. If you
want to make larger changes, probably best to discuss it on the mailing
list first.

Website pages to be published should be stored in the `public` folder -
other resources (that should not be published) can be stored elsewhere
in this repository - for example CoffeeScript source files or LESS/SASS
stylesheets.

The website is built using Twitter Bootstrap.
